* Astro Zombies Theme

I made this Emacs theme while listening to the Misfits. It's one of my favorite bands and these are kind of the colors I saw while listening. Also with a lot of help of [[https://lospec.com/palette-list/gothic-bit][HiroHi and their color palette at LOSPEC]].

** How I use it?

I run EXWM on my work station, so basically I use for everything. I will be adding more faces when I need them.
- I run doom-modeline, although it works well with the original Emacs mode-line.
- I do development in Emacs Lisp and JavaScript.
- More incoming...
